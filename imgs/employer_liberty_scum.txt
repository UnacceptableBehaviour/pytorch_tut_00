Todays deliveries,
Were for the most part prosaic,
Various verbal abuse, mostly water off a ducks back.
Systemic problems with the delivery pipeline,
culturally ingrained indifference to said issues, mostly because of indifference from their employer. Note said key workers are supplying folk critical food and supplies to the whole country! 
I was told to fuck off by a womans 18 y/o son the other day, he ran upstairs after being dismissed by his mother, he gave me the bird and told me to fuck off again after pointing out that I'd been paid to deliver the food. £9.14 an hour doesn't really take into account that every time I walk up to a house and some furious, probably frustrated, MASKLESS teenager spits at me that I've been paid to deliver his food (AND LIFELINE) during lockdown, there's a significant possibility that I might take an infection back to my family home. Infect my family - lets be specific, my mum who will shortly celebrate her 70th birthday - and have to watch them die through a plastic sheet. 
Sorry what was your 18 yo child paying me? I'm taking this risk for your family. And what about mine?

We've had our £15 / month good driver bonus removed (I didn't touch it until Christmas and then used all of it to make Christmas a bit GOOD!), and replaced with a lottery 'if your drive well you might win a mustang' cheapest is $27K that 19K GBP! @ 15 / month that's 105 years (assuming no other employees) with 80 on site that'd be about 8000 years for all of us to get a bonus. 

So for the new system to be profitable . . . I won't win that prize for 105 years (assuming no other employees), presuming its the same system and it wasn't introduced to make the shareholder more profit! (..and there's no inflation)

In a 105 years we'll be feeding it bananas and travelling through time - the mustang that is!
